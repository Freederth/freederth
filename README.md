Hello! My name is Isabel Achurra and I'm a developer trainee.
But enough about the obvious matters and let's talk about stuff that may or not interest you.

## Programming
- My first programming language was C, the most fearsome beast ever made! and if you also want to be a part of "the weirdos" go checkout our Overlords Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie's [book about it](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf). May he rest in peace.
- But as I mention how much C shaped my ways into programming, I can't stop thinking about... [How much I really hate OOP](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM). So if you ever speak to me, don't ever dare to mention polymorphism or... *Java*

#### I speak Spanish, Swedish and English.
